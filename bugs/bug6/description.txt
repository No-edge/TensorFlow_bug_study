Author get a SIGSEGV signal when load_model, then he run it step by step, find it is caused by lambda layer.

It is because load_model need more arguments, in its parameter custom_objects, we need to add some_number, batch_size, sample_size, reps, everything in custom_objects,
which occur in the lambda layer.
